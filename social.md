🎯 **Tired of typing the same Git commands over and over?**

I just released **Laravel Git Sync** - a package that streamlines your Git workflow to a single command!

**Before:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature"
git push origin main
```

**After:**
```bash
git-sync -m "Update feature"
```

**Key Features:**
✅ Install once, use everywhere (global installation)
✅ Auto-generated timestamped commits
✅ Multiple workflow modes (commit-only, push-only, dry-run)
✅ Works in Laravel AND non-Laravel projects
✅ Smart error handling & branch detection

**Quick Start:**
```bash
composer global require aaronidikko/laravel-git-sync
git-sync -m "My first sync!"
```

Perfect for developers who value their time and want to focus on coding, not repetitive Git commands.

**Title:** [Package] Laravel Git Sync - Commit & push with one command

**Body:**

Hey Laravel developers! 👋

I built a package that saves me dozens of keystrokes every day, and thought you might find it useful too.

**Laravel Git Sync** lets you stage, commit, and push changes with a single command:

```bash
git-sync -m "Your commit message"
```

That's it. No more typing `git add .`, `git commit -m "..."`, and `git push` separately.

**Features:**
- 🌍 Global installation - install once, use in all projects
- ⏰ Auto-generated timestamps if you're lazy like me
- 🔍 Dry-run mode to preview what will happen
- 🎯 Commit-only or push-only modes
- 🛡️ Smart error handling (detects missing remotes, upstream branches, etc.)
- 📦 Works in non-Laravel projects too!

**Installation:**
```bash
composer global require aaronidikko/laravel-git-sync
```

**Usage:**
```bash
git-sync -m "Add new feature"
git-sync --commit-only
git-sync --dry-run
git-sync --branch=develop
```

It's free, open-source, and has been saving me a ton of time. Hope it helps you too!
